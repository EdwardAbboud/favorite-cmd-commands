# favorite-cmd-commands
My most used commands are:

# touch
touch will create a new file in any directory it's called in, the filetype can also be specified at the end of the filename

# mkdir
This command will create a new directory. It has been extremely useful in organizing my code

# code . 
After making a new directory and then creating a new file i usually open my code editor using code . which opens all the files in the directory
